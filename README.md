Implementation of the well known but boring game.  
In my opinion it is far more fun to make it than playing it.

## How To Play
```
npm install
```

Then start index.html in your favorite web browser.  
If it doesn't work, then your favorite browser sucks =) .

## Why ? 

I made this for a friend who is learning JS, and for my pleasure (of coding).
